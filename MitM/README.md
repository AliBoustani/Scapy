#MitM

Man-in-the-Middle attack (MITM) is an attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the
communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other

More Info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack

One of the best ways to test your network against different attacks and determine vulnerabilities is to actually
simulate that threat!

This App has written for educational purposes and its aim is to increase general awareness about the MitM 
attack, which is one of the most reported threats even in this era!!

Caution: Do this just with authorization and in a safe lab! Be careful about production environments!!

Please, Share your experience :)
